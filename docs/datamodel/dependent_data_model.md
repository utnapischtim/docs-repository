# Dependend Data Model

The dependent data model assumes that the invenio-rdm-records data model is the
root for all data models ever implemented for InvenioRDM. It servers as a
"library" to create other data models by providing the components to create
access management, versioning etc. This implies that the invenio-rdm-records
data model has to be installed otherwise it is not possible to have a
repository.

The main difference to the independent data model is that the
invenio-rdm-records data model is installed out of the box.
